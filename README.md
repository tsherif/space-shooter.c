Description
-----------
`space-shooter.c` is a cross-platform, top-down 2D space shooter written in standard C11 using only system libraries (with system libraries defined as anything included in the C standard library or supported operating systems). `space-shooter.c` has been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 16.04. This project drew heavy inspiration from [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) and [pacman.c](https://github.com/floooh/pacman.c).

The design and architecture of `space-shooter.c` is described [here](./ARCHITECTURE.md) [WIP].

### Caveat
I am not a professional game developer, nor a professional C programmer, so the design may be unconventional or sub-optimal in many ways. Happy to take feedback from any pros out there!

Building
--------
Windows
- In a shell with [cl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160) set up, run `build.bat` for a debug build or `build.bat release` for an optimized build.
- Run `space-shooter.exe` from the `build/` directory.

Linux
- Make sure development headers for the Linux kernel, Xlib, glx and ALSA are installed.
    - E.g. on Ubuntu, run the following: `sudo apt install linux-libc-dev libx11-dev mesa-common-dev libasound2-dev`  
- Run `make` for a debug build or `make release` for an optimized build.
- Run `./space-shooter` from the `build/` directory.

Note: In case the `build/space-shooter` binary is copied to a separate folder, you will also need to copy `build/assets` to the same folder.
